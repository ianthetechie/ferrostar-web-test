# ferrostar-web-test

This is a demo integration of [Ferrostar Web](https://stadiamaps.github.io/ferrostar/)
using Vue 3 and Vite.

Have a look around and see how you might build a web-based
turn-by-turn navigation experience :)

You can also check out the [demo](https://ianthetechie.github.io/ferrostar-web-test/)
